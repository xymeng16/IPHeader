# IPHeader
A simple program to generate normal IPHeader.
## COMPILE
Currently this program can only be compiled and run on windows platform.
It's recommended to compile it via Visual Studio by opening the 
whole solution.  
**As I used the winsock32.h, the library winsock32.lib must be added into the reference when linking.**
## INPUT
The source and destination IP addresses.
## OUTPUT
The content of the IP header, displayed in hex,byte by byte.
Like:  
  
        45 00 00 14  
        D6 67 00 00  
        FF 01 74 11  
        AC 10 0B C8  
        AC 10 0B 87
## Something Else
This program is still in developing and many new features will be added into it.
